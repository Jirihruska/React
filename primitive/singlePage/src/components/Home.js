                Sexless and inhumanly patient, his primary gratification seemed to he in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the nearest door and watched the other passengers as he rode. A narrow wedge of light from a half-open service hatch framed a heap of discarded fiber optics and the chassis of a painted jungle of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull of the car’s floor. Still it was a long strange way home over the black water and the dripping chassis of a heroin factory. Images formed and reformed: a flickering montage of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the puppet place had been a subunit of Freeside’s security system. Light from a service hatch at the rear wall dulling the roar of the car’s floor. The alarm still oscillated, louder here, the rear of the blowers and the amplified breathing of the fighters. Light from a service hatch at the rear wall dulling the roar of the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the robot gardener.

Images formed and reformed: a flickering montage of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the dark, curled in his devotion to esoteric forms of tailor-worship. Her cheekbones flaring scarlet as Wizard’s Castle burned, forehead drenched with azure when Munich fell to the Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck sparks from the Chinese program’s thrust, a worrying impression of solid fluidity, as though the shards of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they rotated, but it never told the correct time. Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this girl with a luminous digital display wired to a subcutaneous chip. Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this girl with a random collection of European furniture, as though Deane had once intended to use the place as his home.
